## Problem

_What's the problem?_

It would be awesome to build a superhero from the ground up and play a collaborative game with others, where you get to improve on that hero each time you play.

### Existing Alternatives

_How else are people solving this problem right now?_

- Classic tabletop RPG games
- Marvel champions

## Customers

_Who has this problem?_

People who love board games, superheroes and building characters over time

## Solution

_How are you solving the problems? Add a link to the latest place to find the current solution_

A legacy collaborative super hero game. Think of a mash up between Pandemic Legacy, Zombicide and Batman: Arkham City Escape.

### High Level Concept

_Describe the solution in a few words that anyone could understand_

A legacy collaborative super hero game. Think of a mash up between Pandemic Legacy, Zombicide and Batman: Arkham City Escape.

## Uncertainties

_What are you most uncertain about? Prioritise this list and add potential tests to help us become more certain_

- **Is the base game good enough, without legacy components**
- **What resource cards would make it fun**
- **What's the minimum ruleset needed to be a good game**
- **Does the attack/move balance work**
- **Is writing scenarios easy enough that players coudl make their own**
- **How do relationships get triggered**
- **What balance of event cards works well**
- **Is the threat tracker a good mechanic?**
- **Is the alarm needed**
- **Does the map work pandemic style, or is a grid of zombicide like moving better**
