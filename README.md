## Rules

### Premise

Every player will be controlling a vigilante superhero who is protecting their fair city from the torment of various villains and their henchmen. As you play the game your vigilante will gain gadgets and abilities that persist between playing sessions and help you defeat stronger villains. Alas the villains too will become stronger and as you keep playing permanent relationships and events will affect how you tackle the villains.

The game contains a whole bunch of different locations throughout the city that the villains will attempt their nefarious deeds. As you play, each location will start getting permanent changes where the villains have destroyed things or you've put into place secret weapon caches and items to aid you.

This is a co-operative game of building superheros and stopping shit hitting the fan.

### Aim of the Game

When you play the game you will pick a scenario and a villain to play against. The scenario will lay out all the winning and losing criteria for you. Usually it is along the lines of preventing a villain from accomplishing their goals, and knocking them out at the end without dying in the process.

### Setup

1. Choose a scenario
2. Choose/build your vigilantes
3. Setup scenario
4. Pick a starting player

#### Choose a scenario

##### Pick a scenario from the scenario book or website

If this is your first time playing, it's probably best to pick the first introductory scenario. Otherwise have a look through the scenario book or on our website (doesn't exist yet).

Some scenarios are part of a campaign, which means they need to be done in order and with the same villain/vigilantes for each scenario you play in that campaign.

##### Pick a villain or draw randomly

If the scenario is part of an ongoing campaign, you must pick the same villain that has been playing in that campaign, unless the scenario says otherwise.

Follow any instructions from the scenario for picking a villain otherwise pick one randomly or specifically pick one yourselves.

When you pick a villain put aside the villain card and all associated villain ability cards (these can be organised with the dividers in the card box), if this is a villain that hasn't been played, just take the villain card and follow any setup instructions on that card.

#### Choose/build your vigilantes

Your chosen scenario will tell you how many vigilantes you can play as. Split these up between the amount of players you have. 1 player can control multiple vigilantes.

If your chosen scenario is part of an ongoing campaign you must pick the same vigilantes that were part of that campaign, unless the scenario says otherwise.

##### Choosing a new vigilante

You'll be doing this on your first game and anytime you want to start building a new hero. Take a vigilante card that doesn't have any gadgets or abilities yet. Read the text on the vigilante card to see if you get to start with any gadget or ability cards. Otherwise you have nothing but your own strength and courage.

##### Playing an existing vigilante

When a vigilante has been played they will start collecting gadgets and abilities that belong to them and which persist between sessions. These cards must be kept together with your vigilante. The easiest way to keep these between games is to use the dividers supplied in the game. Take out all the cards attached to your chosen vigilante.

#### Setup scenario

- In the location booklet, go to the location specified in the scenario
- Follow the setup instructions in the scenario, which is likely to include:
  - Special instructions for building the event deck
    - Such as removing some cards from the deck, shuffling, putting some in specific places
  - Place starting enemies
  - Place enemy objectives
  - Place vigilante objectives
  - Place any starting location items
- Place 1 MediKit Space item on a space of your choosing (it can't be on a space with another space item)
- Place 1 Recharge Pack Space item on a space of your choosing (it can't be on a space with another space item)

#### Pick a starting player

Pick one of the following ways to decide who the first player is and give them the starting player token:

- Last person to stop a crime
- Person who gets most angry over crime
- Get everyone to tell a passionate speech about how bad the crime is in this city, and vote on the most inspiring person to go first

### Turn order

1. Enemy Phase
2. Vigilante Phase
3. Event Phase

### Phases

#### 1. Enemy Phase

Each enemy on the board get's activated once, unless a card of effect says otherwise.

You activate enemies in the following order (when there's multiple of a specific type, you get to choose):

1. Villains
2. Fast henchmen
3. Special henchmen
4. Normal henchmen
5. Strong henchmen

For each activation the enemy will do the first of these actions that is applicable, unless a card or ability says otherwise (Note: Scenarios may often specify a custom action priority order for enemies, that overrules this):

1. Attack - Attack a vigilante (See the Attacking section) if possible (if multiple vigilantes could be attacked, the closest one is picked, otherwise flip a coin to decide)
2. Raise the alarm - Raise the alarm (See the Alarm section) if it is off and they can see a vigilante
3. Move (See the Movement section) towards a vigilante they can see - (if there are multiple vigilantes they can see the closest one is picked, otherwise flip a coin to decide)
4. Move towards a vigilante they can hear - (if there are multiple vigilantes they can hear the closest one is picked, otherwise flip a coin to decide)
5. Activate an objective - Spend an action on an enemy objective, what this does will be described in the scenario
6. Move towards the nearest enemy objective (See the Escorting section)
7. Do nothing

#### 2. Vigilante Phase

Starting with the player who has the starting player token, each vigilante that player controls can take 3 actions (unless a card or ability says otherwise). The player must do all actions with 1 vigilante before moving onto another. A vigilante can do the following actions:

- Move 1 space (See the Movement section)
- Attack an enemy (See the Attacking section)
- Use an action written on a card your vigilante has
- Use an action associated with anything on your space (See Space Items section)
- Use a vigilante action described in the scenario
- Do nothing and gain 1 energy (See the Energy section)

Some cards or abilities may allow the vigilante to do a free action. This does not cost 1 of your 3 actions to do.

#### 3. Event Phase

1. Determine the threat level
   1. Count all the enemies on the board. Divide by 2 and round up. Ensure the threat tracker is on this number (unless it is below the starting threat level)
2. Draw and resolve an event card (These should be self explanatory cards that do things like Spawn)
   1. If the alarm is on, draw and resolve 2 event cards instead of 1
3. Check for any Triggers (See Triggers Section) that say "At the end of the Event Phase" and resolve these now
4. Move the Turn Tracker (See the Turn Tracker) (if the scenario includes a tracker)
5. Move first player token
6. Check for any Triggers (See Triggers Section) that say "At the beginning of the Enemy Phase" and resolve these now

### Finishing a game

#### You win if

- You have completed all the objectives listed on your chosen scenario

#### You lose if

- You meet any lose conditions listed on your chosen scenario
- All vigilantes have been knocked out
- The enemies have completed all their objectives
- The turn tracker reaches 0 (if your scenario includes the turn tracker)

#### End of game actions

- If you won, the villain has vowed to get more men to defeat you. They're watching this location now. Increase the starting threat level by placing a threat sticker over the lowest visible number on the threat tracker (Only do this for scenarios that are part of a campaign)
- If you lost, you are determined to make this location safe, you may make any space item permanent by placing a sticker of it's colour on that space (as long as no other sticker is on that space). (Only do this for scenarios that are part of a campaign)
- Check the scenario for any additional affects

## Reference

### Space

A space is a single point on the map/location which represents a space that an enemy or vigilante piece can occupy. Pieces can only ever be on a space if they are in play.

### Movement

Enemies or Vigilantes can move between 2 spaces that are connected via a Route. There are 3 types of routes:

1. Normal (represented by a solid line connecting 2 spaces)
2. Crawl (represented by a dashed line connecting 2 spaces)
3. Aerial (represented by a dotted line connecting 2 spaces)

An enemy or vigilante can only move along a route if the vigilante/villain or henchman card for that piece contains the type of route you are trying to go along (This will be under the movement section of the card).

Typically each of these pieces can only move along 1 route as 1 action, but their card may overrule this.

### Attacking

Normally any piece that attacks can only attack another piece on the same space as it. There are gadgets and abilities that change this and will explain their own methods for attacking and dealing damage. The following is for attacking a piece on the same space.

#### When a vigilante attacks

When a vigilante attacks you follow the following process:

1. Choose an enemy to attack and look at their Defense Value. This is the value you need to roll to knock them out.
2. Determine how many attack dice to use
   1. You always get to start with 1 dice for free
   2. Your vigilante card may let you add more free dice
   3. You may be able to use any gadgets or abilities at this stage to increase your attack dice
   4. You can spend energy to get more attack dice. For every energy you spend, you gain 1 attack dice. This energy is used immediately at this stage.
3. Roll the dice and calculate your final attack value
   1. Attack dice have 3 different faces
      1. Plus - Represents a hit! +1 to your attack score
      2. Blank - Represents a near miss. Do not add anything to your attack score. However you can spend 1 energy at this point to turn this near miss into a hit. If you do change this dice to a plus.
      3. Minus - Represents a miss. It does not do anything to your attack score and you cannot modify this dice result.
4. Determine the outcome
   1. If your final attack score is equal to or greater than the enemies defense value then you have knocked them out. Remove them from the board.
   2. If you failed to knock them out, nothing happens
5. If you knocked them out
   1. Randomly pick a reward card and resolve it's effects

##### Attacking a Villain

When a vigilante attacks a villain it's a little different. A villain has health. When you place a villain on the board you put a health dice on it's card representing it's current health. Every time you successfully attack a villain, their health goes down by 1. When it reaches 0, they are then knocked out. You only get a reward when they are completely knocked out, not for every successful attack.

Your vigilante may have a card that lets them deal more damage to a villains health on a successful attack.

#### When an enemy attacks

When an enemy attacks you they automatically succeed (unless you have a card that tells you otherwise). They will do damage to you equal to the enemies Attack Value. Reduce the targeted vigilantes health dice by this amount. If their dice goes down to 0, they are Knocked Out (See the Knocked Out section). Note, some enemies may have additional effects that happen to you when you get attacked.

### Alarm

The alarm represents whether the enemies are alerted to your presence or not.

Most scenarios start with the Alarm off. Make sure you place the alarm token with the silent side up, somewhere near the board.

When the alarm is on, you will end up drawing additional event cards at the end of each round, this is not normally good for you, as event cards normally contain enemy spawns or activations. There is no way to turn the alarm off.

### Sight

A piece can see another piece if there is a continuous straight line connecting the both spaces each piece is on. (There can be multiple spaces in between, as long as the routes connecting them are a single straight line). This works up to a a maximum of 4 spaces (Including the both spaces each piece is on). Sight can work across multiple types of routes, only if the piece doing the seeing has the ability to move along those routes.

### Hearing

Hearing works in the same way as sight but the direction does not have to be in a straight line and the maximum distance is 3 spaces (Including the both spaces each piece is on).

### Escorting

Some scenarios will get enemies to pick up an objective token and try and get it to a particular space. When this happens, only 1 enemy can be carrying the objective, the other enemies will try to occupy the same space as the one carrying the objective and escort/protect that enemy as it makes its journey. Which ever enemy first activated on the objective token to pick it up, is the one carrying it. You could place a spare objective token on the card that represents that enemy to serve as a reminder for which one has it.

### Space Items

Space items are items that vigilantes can spend an action on when they occupy that space. These items can take the form of permanent items, represented by stickers, or temporary ones, represented by Space Item Pieces.

When placing a space item sticker or piece it should go on the small square that's next to that space. You can only ever have one Space Item on any given Space.

### Energy

Energy represents how much energy a vigilante has to spend on attacking or triggering ability cards. Their energy is represented via the number on an energy dice. The vigilante can never have more energy than the max energy rating on their card. There are various cards that will allow you to gain energy, you can also spend an action to increase your energy by 1.

### Health

Health represents how close to being knocked out a villain or vigilante is. Their health is represented via the number on a health dice. The vigilante/villain can never have more health than the max health rating on their card. There are various cards that will allow you to gain health.

### Charge

Charge and charge tokens represent a single use of a gadget. When you start a game or acquire a new gadget you place a number of charge tokens on the gadget card equal to the max charge rating on that card. When you use a gadget you must remove a charge token from the gadget card. You cannot use a gadget that has no charge on it. There are various cards that will allow you to gain charge.

### Spawn zones, spawning and placing enemies

Every scenario will specify which spaces on the map are spawn zones. Sometimes spawn zones will only become active when the threat tracker has reached a certain point.

When a card or during setup you have been told to place an enemy on a space, find the enemy piece and place it on that space. You will also want to make sure the henchman or villain card representing that enemy is on the side of the board so you can see that enemies stats and abilities.

### Abilities

An ability is a special action your vigilante can take. The text on the ability card should explain how it works. Abilities will cost energy to use as well as an action.

### Gadgets

Gadgets are special items your vigilante can use at various points in the game. The text on the card should explain how to use it. Gadgets require charge to be able to use them.

### Villain Abilities

Villain abilities are cards that extend the power of villains, they will describe how they are used on the card. They should be kept with their villain and persisted between game sessions.

### Henchmen Cards

Henchmen cards are cards that describe each type of henchmen and their stats or special abilities. Each villain will have 1 henchman card for each type of henchmen. As the henchmen for 1 villain will be different to that of another.

### Triggers

Triggers are specific criteria in the game at which point you should do the described action. A trigger could be something like: At the start of the Enemy Phase do...

### Threat Tracker

The threat tracker is a track present on every location that is used to see how fucked up the location is. It gets set during the Event Phase of each round. Various cards will refer to this Threat Level to decide on various outcomes. Through playing campaigns you may add stickers to the threat tracker which raise the minimum threat level the tracker can be at.

### Turn Tracker

The turn tracker is sometimes used by scenarios to track the passing of time. It normally is used to count down to something like a bomb exploding. If the turn tracker is in use and it gets down to 0, you will lose the game.

### Relationships

Relationships are stickers that get placed on villain or vigilante cards, which will apply special affects only related to those specific villain/vigilante. They will be self explanatory and get placed during various campaigns.

### Location/Map

The location or map is a spread inside the location handbook. It is the board where you play all your games. Each one contains the following:

- Spaces
- Routes
- Threat Tracker
- Turn Tracker

### Stickers

Stickers and permanent markers/changes are only made during scenarios that are part of a campaign. Individual scenarios are meant to be lighter game play alternatives that don't affect other games.

### Getting Knocked Out

When a piece is knocked out you must remove it from the board.

### Reward Cards

Reward cards are used when you knock out an enemy and will specify what benefits you get.
